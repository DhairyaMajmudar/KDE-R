<p class="calibre1">This introduction to R is derived from an original set of notes
describing the S and <small class="sc">S-PLUS</small> environments written in 1990–2 by
Bill Venables and David M. Smith when at the University of Adelaide.  We
have made a number of small changes to reflect differences between the
R and S programs, and expanded some of the material.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">We would like to extend warm thanks to Bill Venables (and David Smith)
for granting permission to distribute this modified version of the notes
in this way, and for being a supporter of R from way back.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Comments and corrections are always welcome.  Please address email
correspondence to <a href="mailto:R-help@R-project.org">R-help@R-project.org</a>.

<h4 class="subheading" id="Suggestions-to-the-reader">Suggestions to the reader</h4>

<p class="calibre1">Most R novices will start with the introductory session in Appendix
A.  This should give some familiarity with the style of R sessions
and more importantly some instant feedback on what actually happens.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many users will come to R mainly for its graphical facilities.
See <a href="R-intro_split_013.html#Graphics">Graphical procedures</a>, which can be read at almost any time and need not wait
until all the preceding sections have been digested.
