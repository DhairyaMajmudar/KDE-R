<p class="calibre1">All R functions and datasets are stored in <em class="emph">packages</em>.  Only
when a package is loaded are its contents available.  This is done both
for efficiency (the full list would take more memory and would take
longer to search than a subset), and to aid package developers, who are
protected from name clashes with other code.  The process of developing
packages is described in <a data-manual="R-exts" href="./R-exts.html#Creating-R-packages">Creating R
packages</a> in <cite class="emph">Writing R Extensions</cite>.  Here, we will describe them
from a user’s point of view.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">To see which packages are installed at your site, issue the command
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; library()
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">with no arguments.  To load a particular package (e.g., the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boot"><strong class="strong">boot</strong></a>
package containing functions from Davison &amp; Hinkley (1997)), use a
command like
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; library(boot)
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">Users connected to the Internet can use the <code class="code">install.packages()</code>
and <code class="code">update.packages()</code> functions (available through the
<code class="code">Packages</code> menu in the Windows and macOS GUIs, see <a data-manual="R-admin" href="./R-admin.html#Installing-packages">Installing
packages</a> in <cite class="emph">R Installation and Administration</cite>) to install
and update packages.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">To see which packages are currently loaded, use
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; search()
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">to display the search list.  Some packages may be loaded but not
available on the search list (see <a href="#Namespaces">Namespaces</a>): these will be
included in the list given by
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; loadedNamespaces()

<p class="calibre1">To see a list of all available help topics in an installed package,
use
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; help.start()
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">to start the <abbr>HTML</abbr> help system, and then navigate to the package
listing in the <code class="code">Reference</code> section.

<h3 class="section" id="Standard-packages-1">13.1 Standard packages</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The standard (or <em class="emph">base</em>) packages are considered part of the R
source code.  They contain the basic functions that allow R to work,
and the datasets and standard statistical and graphical functions that
are described in this manual.  They should be automatically available in
any R installation.  See <a data-manual="R-FAQ" href="R-FAQ.html#Which-add_002don-packages-exist-for-R_003f">R
packages</a> in <cite class="emph">R FAQ</cite>, for a complete list.

<h3 class="section" id="Contributed-packages-and-CRAN-1">13.2 Contributed packages and <abbr class="acronym">CRAN</abbr></h3>
<a id="index-CRAN"></a>

<p class="calibre1">There are thousands of contributed packages for R, written by many
different authors.  Some of these packages implement specialized
statistical methods, others give access to data or hardware, and others
are designed to complement textbooks.  Some (the <em class="emph">recommended</em>
packages) are distributed with every binary distribution of R.  Most
are available for download from <abbr>CRAN</abbr>
(<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/">https://CRAN.R-project.org/</a> and its mirrors) and other
repositories such as Bioconductor (<a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">https://www.bioconductor.org/</a>).
The <em class="emph">R FAQ</em>
contains a list of CRAN packages current at the time of release, but the
collection of available packages changes very frequently.

<div class="top-level-extent" id="Namespaces">
<h3 class="section" id="Namespaces-1">13.3 Namespaces</h3>
<a id="index-Namespace"></a>
<a id="index-_003a_003a"></a>
<a id="index-_003a_003a_003a"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Packages have <em class="emph">namespaces</em>, which do three things: they allow the
package writer to hide functions and data that are meant only for
internal use, they prevent functions from breaking when a user (or other
package writer) picks a name that clashes with one in the package, and
they provide a way to refer to an object within a particular package.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, <code class="code">t()</code> is the transpose function in R, but users
might define their own function named <code class="code">t</code>.  Namespaces prevent
the user’s definition from taking precedence, and breaking every
function that tries to transpose a matrix.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two operators that work with namespaces.  The double-colon
operator <code class="code">::</code> selects definitions from a particular namespace.
In the example above, the transpose function will always be available
as <code class="code">base::t</code>, because it is defined in the <code class="code">base</code> package.
Only functions that are exported from the package can be retrieved in
this way.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">The triple-colon operator <code class="code">:::</code> may be seen in a few places in R
code: it acts like the double-colon operator but also allows access to
hidden objects.  Users are more likely to use the <code class="code">getAnywhere()</code>
function, which searches multiple packages.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Packages are often inter-dependent, and loading one may cause others to
be automatically loaded.  The colon operators described above will also
cause automatic loading of the associated package.  When packages with
namespaces are loaded automatically they are not added to the search
list.
