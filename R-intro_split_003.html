<h3 class="section" id="The-R-environment-1">1.1 The R environment</h3>

<p class="calibre1">R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data
manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  Among other things it
has
</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li class="calibre3">an effective data handling and storage facility,
</li><li class="calibre3">a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
</li><li class="calibre3">a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data
analysis,
</li><li class="calibre3">graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at
the computer or on hardcopy, and
</li><li class="calibre3">a well developed, simple and effective programming language (called ‘S’)
which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and
input and output facilities.  (Indeed most of the system supplied
functions are themselves written in the S language.)
</li></ul>

<p class="calibre1">The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully
planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of
very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other
data analysis software.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive
data analysis.  It has developed rapidly, and has been extended by a
large collection of <em class="emph">packages</em>.  However, most programs written in
R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data
analysis.

<div class="top-level-extent" id="Related-software-and-documentation">
<h3 class="section" id="Related-software-and-documentation-1">1.2 Related software and documentation</h3>

<p class="calibre1">R can be regarded as an implementation of the S language which
was developed at Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and
Allan Wilks, and also forms the basis of the <small class="sc">S-PLUS</small> systems.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">The evolution of the S language is characterized by four books by
John Chambers and coauthors.  For R, the basic reference is <em class="emph">The
New S Language: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and
Graphics</em> by Richard A. Becker, John M. Chambers and Allan R.
Wilks.  The new features of the 1991 release of S
are covered in <em class="emph">Statistical Models in S</em> edited by John M.
Chambers and Trevor J. Hastie.  The formal methods and classes of the
<strong class="strong">methods</strong> package are based on those described in <em class="emph">Programming
with Data</em> by John M. Chambers.  See <a href="R-intro_split_022.html#References">References</a>, for precise
references.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are now a number of books which describe how to use R for data
analysis and statistics, and documentation for S/<small class="sc">S-PLUS</small> can
typically be used with R, keeping the differences between the S
implementations in mind.  See <a data-manual="R-FAQ" href="R-FAQ.html#What-documentation-exists-for-R_003f">What documentation exists for R?</a> in <cite class="emph">The R statistical system FAQ</cite>.

<h3 class="section" id="R-and-statistics-1">1.3 R and statistics</h3>
<a id="index-Packages"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Our introduction to the R environment did not mention
<em class="emph">statistics</em>, yet many people use R as a statistics system.  We
prefer to think of it of an environment within which many classical and
modern statistical techniques have been implemented.  A few of these are
built into the base R environment, but many are supplied as
<em class="emph">packages</em>.  There are about 25 packages supplied with R (called
“standard” and “recommended” packages) and many more are available
through the <abbr>CRAN</abbr> family of Internet sites (via
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org">https://CRAN.R-project.org</a>) and elsewhere.  More details on
packages are given later (see <a href="R-intro_split_014.html#Packages">Packages</a>).
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most classical statistics and much of the latest methodology is
available for use with R, but users may need to be prepared to do a
little work to find it.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an important difference in philosophy between S (and hence
R) and the other main statistical systems.  In S a statistical
analysis is normally done as a series of steps, with intermediate
results being stored in objects.  Thus whereas SAS and SPSS will give
copious output from a regression or discriminant analysis, R will
give minimal output and store the results in a fit object for subsequent
interrogation by further R functions.

<div class="top-level-extent" id="R-and-the-window-system">
<h3 class="section" id="R-and-the-window-system-1">1.4 R and the window system</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The most convenient way to use R is at a graphics workstation running
a windowing system.  This guide is aimed at users who have this
facility.  In particular we will occasionally refer to the use of R
on an X window system although the vast bulk of what is said applies
generally to any implementation of the R environment.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most users will find it necessary to interact directly with the
operating system on their computer from time to time.  In this guide, we
mainly discuss interaction with the operating system on UNIX machines.
If you are running R under Windows or macOS you will need to make
some small adjustments.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Setting up a workstation to take full advantage of the customizable
features of R is a straightforward if somewhat tedious procedure, and
will not be considered further here.  Users in difficulty should seek
local expert help.
</p>
<hr class="calibre4"/>
</div>
<div class="top-level-extent" id="Using-R-interactively">
<h3 class="section" id="Using-R-interactively-1">1.5 Using R interactively</h3>

<p class="calibre1">When you use the R program it issues a prompt when it expects input
commands.  The default prompt is ‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">&gt;</code></samp>’, which on UNIX might be
the same as the shell prompt, and so it may appear that nothing is
happening.  However, as we shall see, it is easy to change to a
different R prompt if you wish.  We will assume that the UNIX shell
prompt is ‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">$</code></samp>’.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">In using R under UNIX the suggested procedure for the first occasion
is as follows:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li class="calibre3"> Create a separate sub-directory, say <samp class="code">work</samp>, to hold data files on
which you will use R for this problem.  This will be the working
directory whenever you use R for this particular problem.

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ mkdir work
$ cd work
</pre></div>

</li><li class="calibre3"> Start the R program with the command

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ R
</pre></div>

</li><li class="calibre3"> At this point R commands may be issued (see later).

</li><li class="calibre3"> To quit the R program the command is

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; q()
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">At this point you will be asked whether you want to save the data from
your R session.  On some systems this will bring up a dialog box, and
on others you will receive a text prompt to which you can respond
<kbd class="kbd">yes</kbd>, <kbd class="kbd">no</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">cancel</kbd> (a single letter abbreviation will
do) to save the data before quitting, quit without saving, or return to
the R session.  Data which is saved will be available in future R
sessions.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p class="calibre1">Further R sessions are simple.
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li class="calibre3"> Make <samp class="code">work</samp> the working directory and start the program as before:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">$ cd work
$ R
</pre></div>

</li><li class="calibre3"> Use the R program, terminating with the <code class="code">q()</code> command at the end
of the session.

</li></ol>

<p class="calibre1">To use R under Windows the procedure to
follow is basically the same.  Create a folder as the working directory,
and set that in the <samp class="code">Start In</samp> field in your R shortcut.
Then launch R by double clicking on the icon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="top-level-extent" id="An-introductory-session">
<h3 class="section">1.6 An introductory session</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Readers wishing to get a feel for R at a computer before proceeding
are strongly advised to work through the introductory session
given in <a href="R-intro_split_017.html#A-sample-session">A sample session</a>.
</p>
<hr class="calibre4"/>

<div class="top-level-extent" id="Getting-help">
<h3 class="section" id="Getting-help-with-functions-and-features">1.7 Getting help with functions and features</h3>
<a id="index-help"></a>

<p class="calibre1">R has an inbuilt help facility similar to the <code class="code">man</code> facility of
UNIX.  To get more information on any specific named function, for
example <code class="code">solve</code>, the command is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; help(solve)
</pre></div>
<a id="index-help-1"></a>

<p class="calibre1">An alternative is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; ?solve
</pre></div>
<a id="index-_003f"></a>

<p class="calibre1">For a feature specified by special characters, the argument must be
enclosed in double or single quotes, making it a “character string”:
This is also necessary for a few words with syntactic meaning including
<code class="code">if</code>, <code class="code">for</code> and <code class="code">function</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; help("[[")
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">Either form of quote mark may be used to escape the other, as in the
string <code class="code">"It's important"</code>.  Our convention is to use
double quote marks for preference.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">On most R installations help is available in <abbr>HTML</abbr> format by
running
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; help.start()
</pre></div>
<a id="index-help_002estart"></a>

<p class="calibre1">which will launch a Web browser that allows the help pages to be browsed
with hyperlinks.  On UNIX, subsequent help requests are sent to the
<abbr>HTML</abbr>-based help system.  The ‘Search Engine and Keywords’ link in the
page loaded by <code class="code">help.start()</code> is particularly useful as it is
contains a high-level concept list which searches though available
functions.  It can be a great way to get your bearings quickly and to
understand the breadth of what R has to offer.
</p>
<a id="index-help_002esearch"></a>
<p class="calibre1">The <code class="code">help.search</code> command (alternatively <code class="code">??</code>) 
allows searching for help in various
ways. For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; ??solve
</pre></div>
<a id="index-_003f_003f"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Try <code class="code">?help.search</code> for details and more examples.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">The examples on a help topic can normally be run by
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; example(<var class="emph">topic</var>)
</pre></div>
<a id="index-example"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Windows versions of R have other optional help systems: use
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; ?help
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">for further details.

<h3 class="section" id="R-commands_002c-case-sensitivity_002c-etc_002e">1.8 R commands, case sensitivity, etc.</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Technically R is an <em class="emph">expression language</em> with a very simple
syntax.  It is <em class="emph">case sensitive</em> as are most UNIX based packages, so
<code class="code">A</code> and <code class="code">a</code> are different symbols and would refer to different
variables.  The set of symbols which can be used in R names depends
on the operating system and country within which R is being run
(technically on the <em class="emph">locale</em> in use).  Normally all alphanumeric
symbols are allowed<a id="DOCF2" href="R-intro_split_022.html#FOOT2"><sup class="calibre2">2</sup></a> (and in
some countries this includes accented letters) plus ‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">.</code></samp>’ and
‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">_</code></samp>’, with the restriction that a name must start with
‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">.</code></samp>’ or a letter, and if it starts with ‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">.</code></samp>’ the
second character must not be a digit.  Names are effectively
unlimited in length.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elementary commands consist of either <em class="emph">expressions</em> or
<em class="emph">assignments</em>.  If an expression is given as a command, it is
evaluated, printed (unless specifically made invisible), and the value
is lost.  An assignment also evaluates an expression and passes the
value to a variable but the result is not automatically printed.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Commands are separated either by a semi-colon (‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">;</code></samp>’), or by a
newline.  Elementary commands can be grouped together into one compound
expression by braces (‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">{</code></samp>’ and ‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">}</code></samp>’).
<em class="emph">Comments</em> can be put almost<a id="DOCF3" href="R-intro_split_022.html#FOOT3"><sup class="calibre2">3</sup></a> anywhere,
starting with a hashmark (‘<samp class="code"><code class="code">#</code></samp>’), everything to the end of the
line is a comment.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a command is not complete at the end of a line, R will
give a different prompt, by default
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">+
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">on second and subsequent lines and continue to read input until the
command is syntactically complete.  This prompt may be changed by the
user.  We will generally omit the continuation prompt
and indicate continuation by simple indenting.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Command lines entered at the console are limited<a id="DOCF4" href="R-intro_split_022.html#FOOT4"><sup class="calibre2">4</sup></a> to about 4095 bytes (not characters).

<h3 class="section" id="Recall-and-correction-of-previous-commands-1">1.9 Recall and correction of previous commands</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Under many versions of UNIX and on Windows, R provides a mechanism
for recalling and re-executing previous commands.  The vertical arrow
keys on the keyboard can be used to scroll forward and backward through
a <em class="emph">command history</em>.  Once a command is located in this way, the
cursor can be moved within the command using the horizontal arrow keys,
and characters can be removed with the <kbd class="key">DEL</kbd> key or added with the
other keys.  More details are provided later: see <a href="R-intro_split_019.html#The-command_002dline-editor">The command-line editor</a>.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">The recall and editing capabilities under UNIX are highly customizable.
You can find out how to do this by reading the manual entry for the
<strong class="strong">readline</strong> library.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alternatively, the Emacs text editor provides more general support
mechanisms (via <abbr>ESS</abbr>, <em class="emph">Emacs Speaks Statistics</em>) for
working interactively with R.  See <a data-manual="R-FAQ" href="R-FAQ.html#R-and-Emacs">R and Emacs</a> in <cite class="emph">The R

<p class="calibre1">If commands<a id="DOCF5" href="R-intro_split_022.html#FOOT5"><sup class="calibre2">5</sup></a> are stored in an external

<h3 class="section" id="Data-permanency-and-removing-objects-1">1.11 Data permanency and removing objects</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The entities that R creates and manipulates are known as
<em class="emph">objects</em>.  These may be variables, arrays of numbers, character
strings, functions, or more general structures built from such
components.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">During an R session, objects are created and stored by name (we
discuss this process in the next section).  The R command
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; objects()
</pre></div>

<p class="calibre1">(alternatively, <code class="code">ls()</code>) can be used to display the names of (most
of) the objects which are currently stored within R.  The collection
of objects currently stored is called the <em class="emph">workspace</em>.
<a id="index-Workspace"></a>
</p>
<p class="calibre1">To remove objects the function <code class="code">rm</code> is available:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&gt; rm(x, y, z, ink, junk, temp, foo, bar)
</pre></div>
<a id="index-rm"></a>
<a id="index-Removing-objects"></a>

<p class="calibre1">All objects created during an R session can be stored permanently in
a file for use in future R sessions.  At the end of each R session
you are given the opportunity to save all the currently available
objects.  If you indicate that you want to do this, the objects are
written to a file called <samp class="code">.RData</samp><a id="DOCF6" href="R-intro_split_022.html#FOOT6"><sup class="calibre2">6</sup></a> in the
current directory, and the command lines used in the session are saved
to a file called <samp class="code">.Rhistory</samp>.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">When R is started at later time from the same directory it reloads
the workspace from this file.  At the same time the associated commands
history is reloaded.
</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is recommended that you should use separate working directories for
analyses conducted with R.  It is quite common for objects with names
<code class="code">x</code> and <code class="code">y</code> to be created during an analysis.  Names like this
are often meaningful in the context of a single analysis, but it can be
quite hard to decide what they might be when the several analyses have
been conducted in the same directory.
